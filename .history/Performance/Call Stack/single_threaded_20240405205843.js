// <--------- Call Stack ------------>

 // <--- Single Threaded --->

 // JavaScript is a single threaded, meaning that it can only execute one thing at a time. 
  // This is because it has only one call stack.
 // It is also called as synchronous language.




// Observation:
  // 1. 'Run-to-completion' nature to code.
  // 2. JS does not execute multiple lines/functions at the same time.
